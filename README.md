# CAN-bus-attack-detection
neural_network_attack contains a simple 3 layer neural network to classify DoS, Fuzzy,  RPM, and gearset attacks based on collected attack and regular functioning car data (from a CAN bus) as either normal ('R') or a threat ('T').

supervised_algorithms_attack contains 6 supervised learning algorithms that classify DoS, Fuzzy,  RPM, and gearset attacks based on collected attack and regular functioning car data (from a CAN bus) as either normal ('R') or a threat ('T').
